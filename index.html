	<h1>Calculate Your Last Frost Date</h1>
	<div id="text">
		<p>In the northern U.S. and Canada, suburban hobby farmers and backyard vegetable gardeners calculate when to plant spring crops based on something called the last frost date. This is the date when gardeners can expect that killing frost won't harm their immature plants.</p>
		<p>For Example, a certain variety of lettuce may suggest that you plant two weeks before the last frost date.</p>
		<p>But when is the last frost date for your specific location?</p>
		<p>This webpage uses historical information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to predict, based on the amount of risk you want to take, the last frost date for your specific area.</p>
